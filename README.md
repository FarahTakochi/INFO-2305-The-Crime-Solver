The police, Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson arrived in the murder scenes. Dr. Watson analyze the body and confirm his friend that  the diplomat has been murdered by someone with a powerful poison half an hour ago. After that, Sherlock Holmes observes the dead body and notices that the victim’s lips have turned purple, his eyes have excess blood and there is a small red dot by his hairline. Therefore he began to search the entire house and collect the evidence. Firstly, he searched the victim’s  room and found a needle laying down the table so he gave it to the police to examine it.
